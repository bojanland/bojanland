- 👋 Hi, I’m @bojanland. My real name is Bojan Landekić. That last character is a ch sound and comes from Serbian. Or rather it comes from Serbo-Croatian, a language I learned while growing up in, not Serbia, but Jugoslavia/Yugoslavia. Fools waged wars in the '90s and we fled to Canada. My first computer was a Commodore 64 and I spent just as much time coding in BASIC as I did playing games. Then we got a 386 and I learned Turbo Pascal and Assembler to make demo routines, and other things with SWAG, which was the beginnings of open source. I was also into BBSes and registered WWIV to get the C source code which I modded a lot and thus learned C programming. Then we got a Pentium with OS/2 Warp and I learned ReXX and such. Then I got into HTML and Photoshop as well as 3D design and Truespace. Worked at Sprint Canada and was the webmaster. Then went to Patriot Computer and build from scratch a Microsoft Access database for their whole call center. Then I learned Cisco and Juniper networking and worked at UUNET, even was the emergency on-call for the Canadian backbone. Then is my favourite word by the way. Then I took ten years to play soccer and become a Kung Fu instructor. Now I am getting into open source development with Java mostly and Ruby. My interests are in the AI world. In my spare time I write music in Reason.
